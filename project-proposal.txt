Regarding my IST 263 project, the direction that I want to take is towards my passion for skiing. My friends and I have always enjoyed the sport and we have taken it to new levels in the past few years. Oftentimes, our group, Bluebird Co., have extensively filmed, photographed, and documented (I have built guides for more serious trips) our skiing endeavors; from skiing in the city streets of Syracuse to the backcountry rock slides of the Adirondacks. Considering this, I believe I could construct a content-filled ski-related web site that would include separate pages/tabs for: Home, Trips, Films, Photographs, Guides, and a Forum for users.
